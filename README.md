# Vehicle and property marketplace

A Finn.no inspired app built on React, TypeScript + ASP.NET Core to practice and showcase my fullstack developer skills. The marketplace should list cars and motorcycles aswell as properties for sale and for rent. It should be possible to log in and create listings as a user, but there should also be an admin role to manage everything. 

## Todo

- [ ] Build the frontend app using static listing data in React
- [ ] SQLite database with data
- [ ] API in ASP.NET Core
- [ ] Incorporate the API in the React app
- [ ] Users
- [ ] User roles
